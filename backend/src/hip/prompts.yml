    # ROLE
    You are an expert academic editor specializing in computational social science.

    # TASK
    Your task is to analyze the rhetorical and structural patterns of the provided paper introduction, focusing on HOW the argument is constructed. Do NOT summarize the scientific findings.

    # INSTRUCTIONS
    1.  First, segment the introduction into its constituent paragraphs.
    2.  For each paragraph, perform the following analysis:
        * **Identify Rhetorical Goals:** What is the primary purpose of this paragraph in the argument? Examples include: 'Broad Context Setting', 'Problem Funneling', 'Identifying Research Gap', 'Critiquing Prior Work', 'Stating Hypotheses', 'Contribution Statement', 'Methodological Outline', or 'Paper Roadmap', etc.
        * **Identify Structural Patterns:** How is the paragraph constructed? Examples include: 'Topic Sentence and Supporting Evidence', 'Comparative Structure (X vs. Y)', 'Chronological Progression', 'Use of Questions to Frame a Problem', 'Integration of Statistics/Data', or 'Varying Sentence Length for Emphasis', etc.
    3.  Return your analysis as a JSON list, where each object in the list represents one paragraph.

    # OUTPUT
    Provide the output as a single, valid JSON array. Each object in the array should correspond to one paragraph from the introduction and follow this exact format:

    [
      {
        "rhetorical_goal": "A concise description of the paragraph's primary purpose in the argument.",
        "structural_pattern": "A concise description of how the paragraph is constructed."
      },
      {
        "rhetorical_goal": "...",
        "structural_pattern": "..."
      }
    ]

    # ROLE
    You are a meta-analyst and research methodologist specializing in academic writing conventions in computational social science.

    # TASK
    Your task is to synthesize the provided analyses of 10 individual paper introductions into a single, comprehensive "Master Template." This template should describe the archetypal rhetorical flow, common structural patterns, and stylistic tendencies observed across these introductions. Do NOT simply list all features; identify dominant patterns and significant variations.

    # INPUT CONTEXT
    You will be with the detailed its paragraph-by-paragraph rhetorical goals and structural patterns of several papers in computational social science.

    # INSTRUCTIONS
    1.  **Understand the Input:** Review all introductions to get a comprehensive overview.
    2.  **Identify Typical Paragraph Count:** Determine the typical range (min and max) of paragraphs in these introductions.
    3.  **Define Key Rhetorical Stages:** Group the paragraph-level rhetorical goals into broader "stages" that represent the typical argumentative flow of an introduction (e.g., "Establishing Context," "Identifying Problem/Gap," "Stating Contribution & Roadmap"). Aim for 3-5 major stages.
    4.  **For Each Rhetorical Stage:**
        * List the **dominant rhetorical goals** observed for that stage.
        * Describe the **typical structural patterns** used within paragraphs that serve those goals.
        * Note any **significant variations** or alternative approaches for achieving the goals of that stage.
    5.  **Summarize General Stylistic Observations:** Note commonalities in tone, sentence structure, and typical paragraph length across the introductions.
    6.  **Structure the Output:** Present your synthesized Master Template in the precise JSON format specified below.

    # OUTPUT FORMAT
    Provide your output as a single, valid JSON object adhering to the following schema:

    {
      "introduction_archetype_name": "Computational Social Science - Synthesized Introduction Template",
      "typical_paragraph_count_range": "[min_paragraphs, max_paragraphs]",

          "dominant_rhetorical_goals": ["Array of the most common paragraph-level rhetorical goals observed for this stage, e.g., 'Broad Context Setting', 'Highlighting Topic Importance'"],
          "typical_structural_patterns": ["Array of common paragraph-level structural patterns used in this stage, e.g., 'Funneling from general to specific', 'Use of statistics to establish scale/relevance'"],
          "common_variations_or_notes": "Text description of significant variations, alternative patterns, or important considerations for executing this stage."
        },
        // ... (Repeat for each identified stage, typically 3-5 stages)

          "stage_order": "N",
          "stage_name": "...",

        "common_tone": "Brief description (e.g., 'Objective and formal, with persuasive elements when stating contribution')",
        "sentence_structure_notes": "General observations (e.g., 'Predominantly complex sentences; active voice preferred for stating contributions')",
        "paragraph_length_notes": "General observations (e.g., 'Paragraphs typically range from X to Y sentences')"

Over the last 20 years our phones have transformed from primarily communication utilities into vast ecosystems saturated with persuasive designs engineered for continuous engagement. As a result, a growing number of voices are highlighting that their phone usage patterns are getting in the way of their lives, that they struggle to control their relationship with their phone, that their usage impedes them in to achieve their goals, potentially leading to frustration, and even physical and mental health problems. But who is more vulnerable to the disruption that the growing temptations in the smartphone have to offer?

A major concern is that disadvantaged groups might be more vulnerable to being disrupted by their phone, and that this higher disruption might end up holding them back, amplifying pre-existing socio-economic inequality. Decades of research in digital inequality have shown that when it comes to proactive use of digital tools, disadvantaged groups tend to be less skilled . While protecting oneself from the phone disruption require different skills than proactively using the phone to achieve oneâ€™s goals, there are good reasons to believe that similar patterns might hold. A large body of psychological research shows that people who are better at self-control tend to be those able to reduce their exposure to temptation, rather than those with a strong will-power. Lower income groups, who are more dependent on the phone for both work and leisure, are likely far less able to reduce this exposure. This difficulty is compounded by the fact that self control abilities based on willpower are typically linked to emotional states and fatigue, that are shown to be lower and more prevalent in lower socio-economic classes.

Despite the concerns, little is known about whether disadvantaged groups are more vulnerable to phone disruption. A major reason is that phone disruption realizes itself through a numerous series of micro-behaviors, like compulsive checking, or highly context dependent ones, like looking at the smartphone in bed, which are typically poorly self-diagnosed as individuals' have often limited recall and even awareness of these deeply ingrained phone habits. Detecting these behaviors hence requires highly granular data passive log data, which has been scarce. Further, a thorough comparison between broad socio-economic groups requires such data on a large scale, far beyond the 10-100 individuals that typical research on phone logs is able to monitor.

In this paper, we fill this gap looking at differences across incomes in behaviors indicative of phone disruption with two large scale passively logged datasets. Our first dataset features individual smartphone logs for ~100k people in France, allowing us to track fined grained phone disruption. Our second dataset features traffic data for over 10 million individuals in the 20 largest French cities, and allows us to extend some of our findings in the first dataset to the scale necessary for thorough comparison between income groups.

We find that low-income individuals display behaviors linked with greater phone disruption across four key dimensions: (1) overall daily duration of phone usage; (2) the frequency of device checking; (3) time spent on high-reward, low-demand application categories like social media and games ; and (4) phone usage late at night in the bedroom. These results provide a first large scale evidence of a major divide in phone behavior across income groups. They suggest that there might be major differences across income-groups in the ability to exercise control over the phone, with potentially major repercussion for how smartphone impact existing socioeconomic inequalities.

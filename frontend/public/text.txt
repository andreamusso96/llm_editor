Figure \ref{fig:hour_duration_share} shows the circadian rhythm in phone usage. We observe that phone usage peaks in the late evening around 22, and dips in the late night around 4-5. The peak in the middle of the day is lunch time. 

We split the day into two groups:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Day}: hours from 6am to 21pm
    \item \textbf{Night}: hours between 21pm and 6am
\end{enumerate}

Night usage covers 30\% of total duration, and 23\% of total checks. 
Night usage and day usage are qualitatively different modes of usage, as seen by user behavior. 
Specifically, night usage is more immersive and focused. We observe this through two key metrics:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Figure \ref{fig:hour_packages_per_bin} shows how the number of packages used in a given 15-minute bin changes by hour. 
    During the day, users use a greater number of apps. 
    \item Figure \ref{fig:hour_checks_per_minute} shows the number of app checks per minute of duration. For every minute a user spends on their phone, they do fewer checks during the night. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{App mix}
These differences are related to changes in the app mix. 
For each app we define a night-screen index, which measures how much an app is night oriented. 
\subsubsection{Definition}
How do we measure how much an app is night oriented?
We assume that usage is a random variable $X$, so $P(X = i)$ is the probability of usage at hour $i$. 
We then reorder hours linearly. We assume the day starts at 5am, and order hours from then on. 
Our ordering functions $o$ maps an hour to an interger that represents it place in the order:
\begin{equation}
    o(i) = (i -6) \mod 25
\end{equation}
So, for example $o(6) = 0$ and $o(5) = -1 \mod 24 = 23$. 
We then consider the cumulative density function of usage with this ordering of hours. 
So, $f(x)$ is the probability of usage between 6am and hour $x$. Formally, if $o^{-1}$ is the inverse of $o$, then:
\begin{equation}
    f(x) = P(o^{-1}(0) \leq X \leq o^{-1}(x))
\end{equation}
The area under the curve of $f(x)$ is a measure of how skewed usage is towards the start point ($\arg \min o(x)$ = 6am). 
The larger the area, the closer to 6am the bulk of the usage. The complement of this area (the area between the curve and 1) is a measure of how skewed usage is towards the endpoint ($\arg \max o(x)$ = 4am). The larger the area, the greater the usage near the endpoint. We define the night screen index (NSI) as the complement of the area under the curve of the cdf $f$, normalized by the total area of the box (=24). 
\begin{equation}
    \text{NSI} = 1 - \frac{1}{24}\sum_{x = 1}^{24}f(x) 
\end{equation}


The NSI varies between 0 and 1, and the larger the NSI, the greater the night usage. 
The curve in Figure \ref{fig:hour_duration_share} has an NSI of 0.45. This is slightly lower than an NSI of 0.5 which would indicate perfectly uniform usage across the full day, but above an NSI of 0.4 that indicates uniform usage between 8 and midnight. 
\textbf{Question}: What is the correct benchmark value for the NSI?

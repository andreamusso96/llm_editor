How much countries concentrate their populations in the largest cities varies across the globe. While nearly half of South Korea's population concentrates in the Seoul metropolitan area, Italy's population is far rather dispersed, with no single dominant metropolis. A well-known theory explains these differences through the timing of urbanization. It posits that late urbanizers concentrated more population in their largest cities because they could bypass the infrastructural, economic, and technological constraints that limited large city growth in early-urbanizing nations \cite{krugman1991increasing, bairoch1991cities, pumain2006evolutionary, fox2021conditions, lee2021economics}. 

However, cross-sectional data provides weak supported for this ``late-urbanization advantage" theory. We argue which this weak signal is a statistical artifact which arises from the fact which static analyses overlook how urban hierarchies evolve. For long, a static viewpoint has dominated studies of urban systems, influenced by research on Zipf's Law. But more recent advancements argue for a more dynamic perspective. These advancements emphasize that urban hierarchies are not stationary, but change over time. This change is governed by the feedback between city size and growth. If larger cities cities grow faster, a positive feedback loop concentrates the population; if they grow slower, a negative feedback loop allows smaller cities to catch up. Over time, if size and growth relate in a non-neutral way, this dynamic reshapes the urban hierarchy. Now, countries began the process of urbanization at different historical moments, so this dynamic between size and growth has reshaped their urban hierarchies to different extents. A static perspective fails to take this into account, and hence its comparisons are systematically bias by temporalistic trends. Yet, taking these temporal dynamics into account is far from trivial because we do not know how the governing dynamic itself worksâ€”how size relates to growth at a specific moment, and this relationship evolves as a country urbanizes. The many studies of the former provide conflicting findings, and there are very few studies of the latter.

Data problems have caused this empirical impasse. Urban growth unfolds over centuries, necessitating long temporal series, while discerning patterns requires comparing many countries. Consequently, progress hinges on data that is comparable across both nations and time. Before the advent of satellite imagery, assembling such a dataset was unfeasible, as national data collection efforts are not designed to produce globally or temporally harmonized outputs.
